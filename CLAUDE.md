- **Unit Tests:** `npm run test` (runs unit tests, ignoring integration tests)
- **Integration Tests:** `npm run test:integration` (runs integration tests)
- **All Tests:** `npm run test:all` (runs all tests)

## Code Architecture

This project is a Cloudflare Worker designed to act as a proxy between the Anthropic Claude API and the Google Gemini API.

- **`src/index.ts`**: The main entry point for the Cloudflare Worker, handling incoming requests and routing them.
- **`src/formatRequestGemini.ts`**: Contains logic for transforming incoming Anthropic API requests into the Google Gemini API format.
- **`src/formatResponseGemini.ts`**: Contains logic for transforming responses from the Google Gemini API back into the Anthropic API format.
- **`src/streamResponseGemini.ts`**: Handles the specifics of streaming responses between the two API formats.
- **`src/logger.ts`**: Provides logging utilities for the worker.
- **`src/types.ts`**: Defines shared TypeScript types and interfaces used across the project.
